10.A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 9 seconds. What is the length of the train?

To find the length of the train, you can use the relationship between speed, time, and distance. Here's how:

    Convert the speed from km/hr to m/s:
    Speed=60 km/hrSpeed=60 km/hr
    1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s
    60 km/hr = 60×5/18
             = 300/18
             = 16.67 m/s

    Use the speed and time to find the length of the train:
    The train crosses a pole in 9 seconds. The length of the train is the distance it travels in that time.

    Length of the train = Speed×TimeLength of the train=Speed×Time
    Length of the train = 16.67 m/s * 9 s
    Length of the train = 150 meters

So, the length of the train is 150 meters.
