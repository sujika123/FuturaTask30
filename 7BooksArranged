7.In how many different ways can 5 books be arranged on a shelf?

Answer:
To determine the number of ways to arrange 5 books on a shelf, we need to calculate the number of permutations of 5 distinct items.

The formula for the number of permutations of nn distinct items is n!n! (n factorial), where n!n! represents the product of all positive integers up to nn.

For 5 books, the calculation is:

5!=5×4×3×2×15!=5×4×3×2×1

Calculating this step by step:

5×4=205×4=20
20×3=6020×3=60
60×2=12060×2=120
120×1=120120×1=120

Therefore, the number of different ways to arrange 5 books on a shelf is 120.
