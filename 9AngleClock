9.What is the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at 7:20?


To find the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at 7:20, we need to calculate the positions of both hands and then determine the angle between them.

Step 1: Calculate the angle of the minute hand

The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves:
360/60 = 6 degrees per minute

At 20 minutes, the minute hand is:
20×6 = 120 degrees

Step 2: Calculate the angle of the hour hand

The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, so it moves:
360/12 = 30 degrees per hour

At 7:00, the hour hand is at:
7×30 = 210 degrees

Additionally, the hour hand moves as the minutes pass. In 20 minutes, the hour hand moves:
20×30/60 = 10 degrees

So, at 7:20, the hour hand is:
210 + 10 = 220 degrees

Step 3: Calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands

The angle between the two hands is the absolute difference between their positions:
220 − 120 = 100 degrees

Therefore, the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at 7:20 is 100 degrees.
